# HUNTeR
App for creating and playing a scavenger hunt. 

## Introduction

The application is web-based, and can be used from either your computer, your tablet, or your mobile phone. Creating lessons is enabled for teachers, and is facilitated by a simple web interface for organizing questions and quizzes.

Participating in a scavenger hunt is easily done using any smartphone. As the application is optimized for usage in a mobile browser, there are no restrictions for the device used. However, your experience will be best when using a recent Android or iPhone device.
