done:
- logging configuration
- docker postgres
- jpa
- enable running tests locally
- reactjs setup (seperate project or included here?)
- maven docker plugin for prod environment
- better client side token-handling for non-browser tokens,
  like in the codesandnotes link
- alternatively, maybe just set up hot reload for react create app
- set up let's encrypt on hsr server

deferred:

open:
- spring security setup
- start creating documentation
- NEVER create a table called user in postgres...
- session management
- user registration (hash salt etc. Is there nothing preimplmented?,
  http://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-registration-password-encoding-bcrypt)
- example of proper logging output
- explain what csrf tokens do:
  https://www.codesandnotes.be/2015/02/05/spring-securitys-csrf-protection-for-rest-services-the-client-side-and-the-server-side/
- set up webpack-dev-server for frontend development (I think that makes sense...)
  -> https://daveceddia.com/hot-reloading-create-react-app/
- think about / evaluate using flow for typechecking in frontend code

Docker commands:

sudo docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml build / up
sudo docker exec -it docker_hunter_1 bash
